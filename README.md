The purpose of this work is to synthesize digital circuits on complex programmable logic devices
(CPLD). In this process, very high speed integrated circuit (VHSIC) hardware description language
called VHDL was used. The rst part of this practical is based on synthesizing combinational and
sequential logics using VHDL. For this process, a Basys2 Spartan-3E FGPA board was used. In
synthesizing logics, an AND gate, a BCD to SSD decoder and a mod 10 counter are synthesized.
The second part of the practical is based on direct digital synthesis (DDS) using the Basys2 FPGA
board combined with a R-2R ladder. In this process, a saw tooth signal, a triangular signal, a
rectangular signal with adjustable duty cycle and a sinusoidal signal are synthesized.
