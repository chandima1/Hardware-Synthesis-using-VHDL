In this practical, hardware synthesis using VHDL was studied. Theoretical and practical knowledge needed in using the Basys2 FPGA board were acquired through this practical. Also, the capabilities and the  practical 
limitations of the FPGA board were practically understood. So, all in all, it can be concluded
that through this practical, all the basic knowledge needed in the use of VHDL in the programming of a FPGA board in any needed application was achieved successfully.
